# rock-paper-scissors
This is my first JavaScript project for The Odin Project.

During this project I:
- learned the importance of scope
- learned that declaring a vabiable inside of a function vs globally completely changes how the code is affected
- created functions using function expression as well as function declaration
- stepped away from my code when it was frustrating, and the answers would come to me
- learned how to break down the problem and solve it in pieces
- Googled, ALOT!
